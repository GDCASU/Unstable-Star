Act One Scene 3 - Meet the Crew

DESC: 
INT. REBELLION’S SPACE STATION

REBEKAH
NORMAL
I can’t believe we made it out of there in one piece…


APOLLO

So what’s your story, new guy? How’d you end up locked up in there?


DESC: 
Jaughn begins to think back on how he got here…
JAUGHN
(inner monologue)
Hmm… Well, it all started when…

NOISE
BEGIN FLASHBACK


INT. GALAXY BORDER SECURITY BOOTH
DESC: 
We open on a small futuristic border security booth that floats through the vast depths of space… 
The security booth is connected to a series of satellites spread across the galaxy’s border, each one projecting an EMP field between them.
Inside, a young adult human is manning the toll booth lazily, reclined in his chair.
JAUGHN
(Inner monologue)
Ugh, this is the most boring job in the world. I can’t believe the Intragalactic Coalition made me a border guard. 
No one ever comes through here, ever since they signed the “Peace” Accords. 
Some peace; both galaxies are too terrified of each other to cross the border anyway.


DESC: 
Jaughn looked out the window at the neighboring swirling galaxy and flashing stars in the distance. 
Normally a beautiful sight, but it’s stayed the same for long enough that it’s started to lose its luster. 
He looked over at his control panel which was developing a thin layer of dust. 


JAUGHN
(Inner monologue)
The ventilation system must not be working as well anymore


NOISE
(over intercom)
JAUGHN’S SUPERVISOR
Get back to work Jaughn! We don’t pay you to laze around all day!


JAUGHN
Work? What work? No one’s been through here in the last 3 system cycles!


JAUGHN’S SUPERVISOR
Watch your tone! We need to stay vigilant to maintain this alliance! 
This peace you’re complaining about is all thanks to the Coalition, and any slips through the cracks can destroy it! 
We are part of something larger, something that you don’t yet understand. 
Now be on your guard! We have an Unknown Ship making its way here right now!
NOISE
*Beep* *Beep* 
DESC: 
Jaughn looked at his radar. Sure enough, there was a green blip on it making its way towards him. 
He looked out the window and saw the unknown ship.
NOISE
[pizza music plays] 

JAUGHN
(inner monologue)
It’s… a pizza delivery ship? 
DESC: 
Jaughn pressed a few buttons on his control panel to talk to the incoming craft.
JAUGHN
(hailing the approaching ship)
Uh, hey there. This is the Intragalactic Border Crossing Station #23, state your purpose for crossing and send me your travel visa. 
Uh, I mean, please.

NOISE
(over the communicator)

PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER
Uhhh hey man, could you let me through without the formal crap? I gotta get through the border right now. 
If I don’t deliver these pizzas to Omicron 12 in the next 30 minutes, they take it out of my pay.


JAUGHN
Sorry, no-can-do, friend. Protocol says you need to send me your credentials before I can permit anything. 
Standard bureaucratic stuff, you know?



NOISE
(over the communicator)
PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER
Come on, help a brother out! Don’t you know how crazy it is to make it across the galaxy in less than 30 minutes?? 
I can tell just by looking at you that we’re both minimum-wage employees dreaming of something better. 
Victims of the establishment. I mean, who cares about the Coalition’s protocol when they don’t help the little guys like us? 
Can’t you just let me through?


JAUGHN
…


JAUGHN
(inner monologue)
Hmm… he seems to be in the same boat as me. He hates his job and just wants to get on with his day. 
I don’t care about the Coalition’s ridiculous red tape. Why would they care about a pizza delivery guy?
…
I’ll turn off my supervisor’s camera. He doesn’t know that I figured out the manual override… he won’t notice. 
And then… let’s just disable the EMP field here… and…
DESC: 
With a series of button presses, the EMP field protecting the border around his security booth flickered off. 
NOISE
[SFX: Security screen turning off]
[SFX: EMP field powering down]


JAUGHN
(over the communicator)
Head on through, and be quick about it.


NOISE
(over the communicator)
PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER
Thanks, brother!


DESC: 
The pizza delivery ship revved its engines and quickly sped through. Just as quickly, Jaughn flipped the EMP field back on and turned his surveillance camera back on. 
NOISE
[SFX: Spaceship rocketing through]
[SFX: EMP field powering back up]


NOISE
(over the communicator)
JAUGHN’S SUPERVISOR
JAUGHN?! JAUGHN?! What the bloody hell just happened?! Was this another so-called “power outage?” 


JAUGHN
Yes sir, and not to worry, I sent the driver back. He wouldn’t supply his credentials.

JAUGHN’S SUPERVISOR
Don’t lie to me! You might have figured out how to turn off my main camera but you forgot about the backup camera! I saw the whole thing! 


JAUGHN
(inner monologue) !-
Wait, how? I turned off the— 
There’s… another camera under the desk?! 
!@$$! I couldn’t see it among all the blinking lights in this place!

(audible) Uhh, I don’t know what you’re talking about, sir, I—


JAUGHN’S SUPERVISOR
I’m hereby placing you under arrest, until you can be court-martialed. Violating border protocol is a class 3 offense. 
Don’t even think about trying to run! You’ll be surrounded within the next 3 minutes! 
Time to learn some respect for the Coalition!
JAUGHN
(inner monologue)
So, this is it. A lifetime of trying to make something of my life, and it all ends over a stupid protocol violation…

NOISE
END FLASHBACK

DESC: 
INT. REBELLION’S SPACE STATION 
JAUGHN
…They took me to the nearest asteroid base where I was court-martialed. I tried to come up with an excuse but I couldn’t. 
They slapped me with a sentence of half my lifespan at Sentinel Max Security for that…


APOLLO

Damn.


REBEKAH
That’s real tough, dude.


EBB

How unfortunate.


JAUGHN
Thank you for getting me out of there. I really appreciate it.


REBEKAH
Well, we were looking for our Captain, but I guess we got the wrong information and found you instead. 




APOLLO

Well, it is what it is… The entire jail’s freaking space dust now! Our Captain probably didn’t survive that, sadly. 
What we got now is this guy. Maybe we can make him a new recruit?


JAUGHN
Me? A new recruit? Listen, you guys are rebels, right? I’m in too deep with the Coalition as it is. I don’t know if I-


REBEKAH
Looks like he’s scared. What good is he to us?


EBB


As a former Coalition Border Guard, he may be privy to secret Coalition intel, which will aid in our continued effort to blow their heads off their shoulders. 
I mean, save the galaxy.


APOLLO


Ooh, secret intel. What do you have for us, Jaughn? I’m ex-Coalition myself, but my intel dried up after I was discharged 7 Earth years ago.


JAUGHN
Uh, well, the Border Unit doesn’t exactly have high security clearance. They wouldn’t even tell me where the bathroom was on my first day…


APOLLO

…


EBB

…


REBEKAH
…


JAUGHN
But, um, I have other great skills too! I went through basic training, and I spent all my downtime reverse-engineering Coalition tech. 
That’s how I knew how to disable my supervisor’s camera.



REBEKAH

Okay, well that’s a start. Not a “Captain” start but a start… and our other captain might as well be space dust, so we need somebody.


APOLLO


You did show some skill flying out of that prison back there. And the way you blew up the Prison Warden? 
That was beau-tee-ful! Definitely new recruit material. Just keep that up and you’ll win over the peanut gallery here.


EBB

According to Section 14, Article 5, Subsection 27 of the Anti-Coalition Rebellion Code, new recruits must have proven themselves through an act of heroism. 
Jaughn has sufficiently proven himself. However, Jaughn must formally pledge himself to the cause.


JAUGHN
(inner monologue)
Hmm… my whole life I’ve felt like a joke and always dreamed of something better. Is this that moment? 
I don’t want to become an outlaw, but given what already happened, I’m already a fugitive. 
My path has already been altered forever, and there’s no turning back now.


DESC: 
He turned back to the three leaders standing in front of him. 


JAUGHN
Alright, I accept. I’ll join you guys.


REBEKAH
Wow. Didn’t expect that.


APOLLO

Hell yeah!


JAUGHN
And I actually remembered some intel that could help you guys.


EBB

We’re listening.


JAUGHN
The only radio station we were allowed to listen to in our booths was K-COAL: the Coalition’s main broadcast channel. 
Way out on the edge of the galaxy, the civilian signal doesn’t reach that well, so we were given the coordinates of each satellite to manually connect to them. 
It may not seem like much, but those signals reach most major systems.


APOLLO
You mean the channel that’s nothing but propaganda? Hmm… Coalition satellites… if we could rewire those…


REBEKAH
…we could send out our own recruitment message!


EBB

Understood. In the absence of the Captain, it seems our next mission has been decided.


APOLLO
Welcome aboard, Jaughn! By the way, the bathroom is down that way to the left.


JAUGHN
Oh… right.


BREAK
