INT. REBELLION’S SPACE STATION
We open with our crew returning to their space station, preparing for what lays ahead of them. 
JAUGHN[a]
I’m still in disbelief that we survived that.


APOLLO


That was amazing Jaughn! We took over those tin cans like it was nothin’!




REBEKAH
I must admit, that went better than I thought it would.


JAUGHN
Oh, well, it was all thanks to you guys. I just came up with the plan.


EBB
…And blew up that annoying Radio host. Don’t forget the way you made him EXPLODE. B O O M!




APOLLO
It wasn’t just planning! You showed some real leadership skills if you ask me. Right, guys?


REBEKAH
Ah, heck. Might as well admit it. We’re still in need of a Captain, and we’ve been doing well so far with you. 


JAUGHN[b][c]
…Captain? Me?[d]


APOLLO


Yeah, no need to be modest about it, my guy. We’ve got the biggest battle yet ahead of us, and we need someone to lead us.


EBB


Section 15, Article 2, Subsection 12 of the Anti-Coalition Rebellion Code says that we have the right to nominate a new Captain in the event the old Captain is unable to perform their duties. All in favor of nominating Jaughn as the new Captain?


[All in Unison]
Aye!


EBB


And there we have it. Jaughn is our new Captain moving forward.




The three leaders and the rest[e][f] of the Rebellion gave Jaughn a round of applause. Jaughn looked around and suddenly felt a level of respect emanating from everyone looking at him. Him? Captain? Jaughn wasn’t used to feeling this important, but he thought about how his leadership got everyone to this point. Perhaps he could be more than a lowly Border Guard after all. Jaughn felt his confidence rise, until he decided to speak:[g]


JAUGHN
Thank you everyone for placing your trust in me as your Captain! I won’t let you down.
 
APOLLO[h][i]


I’m sure you won’t, Captain!


REBEKAH
Now we need to figure out a plan to make it to the [Away] System. That entire System is under Coalition control.


EBB


And they’re going to be looking for us, after we sent out that message.


JAUGHN
We need to figure out a blind spot in the Coalition’s defenses. Somewhere they’re not watching in that system. Ebb, do we still have the satellites’ data?


EBB


Yes. I will begin scanning the 5 yottabytes of retrieved satellite data for clues. This will take a while.


JAUGHN
I’m remembering something from my training… Skip ahead to anything mentioning the Delta-X5 Sector. That was our codename for the [Away] System.


EBB
Got it. Here’s something interesting. “Abandonment of the Delta X5 Munitions Factory.” It seems an engine core failure caused the permanent shutdown of that factory. All Coalition presence pulled out afterwards. It’s on the outskirts of the system.


REBEKAH
I’m plotting a course now. That could give us a way in without being noticed.


APOLLO[j][k]
…and then we can clear a path to Proximus 3 for the other fighters[l]!


JAUGHN
Alright, we have a plan. Let’s move everyone!


The Rebellion’s ships are quickly scrambled and everyone prepares to warp to the [Away] System.


Act Three Scene 2 - Dark Clouds Swirl


EXT. THE ABANDONED COALITION FACTORY - AWAY SYSTEM
The ships warp into the Away System one by one, translating into an open sector near the abandoned factory Ebb discovered. Heaps of debris of destroyed homes and civilian ships litter the area surrounding the factory. It floats there in the cold stillness of space. The crew is stunned and silent. 


REBEKAH
…
APOLLO
…


JAUGHN
What is all this? What happened here?




APOLLO
…These are civilian ships and stations… They’re all destroyed…


REBEKAH
No survivors, either. They’re all dead.


EBB
…


REBEKAH
The Coalition must’ve silenced all opposition to build this factory here. And now it’s just left abandoned to litter this sector anyway. What a waste.


JAUGHN
I used to believe the Coalition was a cause for good in our galaxy, but they’ve lost their way. I can’t believe this.


EBB
And so it falls to us to avenge their deaths. Permission to use lethal force[m], Captain?


JAUGHN
…
Jaughn stops to think. He summons his courage and clears his throat…
JAUGHN
Our next battle is quickly approaching, everyone. The Coalition has taken from people their homes, their families, their livelihoods. If we don’t stop them, countless lives will continue to be lost. I don’t like it, but the Coalition is out for blood, and we need to do whatever we can to stop them and avenge these deaths. Use of lethal force is hereby granted.


APOLLO
Looks like we don’t have a choice, huh… We need to clear a path to Proximus 3, or those fighters will be killed, too.


REBEKAH
We’ll have each other, especially if we get the additional backup. We’re a team[n].
EBB
Now you’re talking, let me get out the B I G  G U N S.








Gameplay*( Lvl 1: the crew clears the route to Proximus 3)[o]


After Gameplay


Meanwhile, the large, shadowy figure from before is seen boarding a ship for the [Away] System. 


SHADOWY FIGURE
So, that’s their plan then. They’ll all be gathered in one place… taking care of them will be easy. Nothing will threaten the Coalition’s plans.


Act Three Scene 3- The Path Ahead
With the Coalition’s security force out of the way, the area around Proximus 3’s orbit is now clear. The crew sat patrolling around the moon, waiting for anyone who might have heard their message…


APOLLO


So this is it huh? Doesn’t look like anyone’s showing up.


REBEKAH
Patience isn’t your strong suit, Apollo. They’ll get here. I’m sure of it…


JAUGHN
If even just a few people show up, we’ll be all the better for it.


A few moments pass. Suddenly, the crew hear the beeping of their radar.[p]


EBB


I’m picking up several signals approaching us. They’re… not Coalition signals. Opening comms. 




One by one, random civilian crafts start warping into the sector. Doctors, farmers, chefs, politicians, people from all walks of life are here. Even… [Pizza delivery theme] pizza delivery drivers…


PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER
Hey guys! Are we late? I hope not, I don’t want to lose my tip.


JAUGHN
YOU?! What are you even doing here?! You got me arrested!![q]


PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER[r]
Wait, really? Sorry about that, my friend. I just saw a fight comin’ on, and since the Coalition keeps taking my tip money, I decided to help out. Let me make it up to you! Anyone order a side of GUNS?
The delivery sign on the roof of his ship transforms into a gun. The other ships prepare their weapons, as well. 


Random Civilian
We’re here to fight too!


Mathematically Predictable Civilian
Got your message!


JAUGHN
Thank you, everyone! With your help, we can win this!


EBB
I’m picking up the Coalition’s signal near the hypergiant star. The ship they have there is… massive. Damage to the star is ongoing.


REBEKAH
I’m navigating us there now. Everyone, follow us and prepare to fight!


Gameplay ( lvl 2: the Rebellion and crew have to fight their way to the giant Coalition ship)




Act Three Scene 4 - The Final Battle (The Johnening)
The Rebellion crew, with the civilian fighters in tow, have cleared their way to the hypergiant star in the center of the system. A giant, vacuum-like mechanical ship can be seen orbiting around it, sucking in plasma from the star.


JAUGHN
What in blazes[s][t] IS that thing??


APOLLO


It’s… sucking the energy out of the star like some kind of giant vacuum!


EBB
The star is incredibly unstable. An implosion… followed by a B I G BOOM is imminent. 


REBEKAH
We need to figure out a way to destroy it now or it will be too late!


The fighters cautiously, but urgently approach the giant ship. Their comms are suddenly interrupted by a strangely familiar voice…
JOHN[u]
Intruders, you are hereby ordered to surrender or be destroyed. You have caused untold damage to the Coalition. I won’t ask again.


APOLLO
Wait… that voice. I know that voice.


REBEKAH
What the f- JOHN? 


JAUGHN
Me?


REBEKAH
No!


EBB
The previous Captain? He’s still alive?


JOHN
Oh yes. Did you think I would be killed so easily?


APOLLO


Yeah, we thought you were dead! What are you doing working for the Coalition??


JAUGHN
Wait, who is this? [v]I’m the Captain now, identify yourself!


JOHN
Oh you poor fools, you didn’t tell him? I’m John[w][x][y], the REAL Captain[z], and you bought my act hook, line, and sinker. I was simply undercover in your little club, so deep undercover in fact that I pretended to get arrested! Your path here was entirely staged by me.[aa] It was by my hand that you rescued this… faker instead of me.


JAUGHN
Faker?? Wait a minute, I think you’re the fake Jaughn here!


JOHN
And now you’ve brought the entire rebellion here. You’ve fallen right into my trap. Our weapon here has absorbed enough solar plasma to kill you all in one blast. And once you’re gone, peace will be restored to the galaxy.


APOLLO

Peace?? You call this peace??


JOHN
Yes, order leads to peace. You have done nothing but undermine our order, which has led to chaos. Don’t you realize the coalition maintains our fragile relationship with our neighboring galaxy?


JAUGHN
I once believed in that lie, but you’re all just a bunch of greedy hacks who will stop at nothing to keep your sham of a relationship going. What good is “order” when you’re killing innocent civilians??


JOHN
I guess you’re too short-sighted to realize that the ends justify the means. The coalition has led to the betterment of mankind, and our benefactors desperately need this star’s plasma. We are simply here to provide.


REBEKAH
But by harvesting the plasma, you’re going to blow up the star! You’re going to cause countless deaths throughout the galaxy! The needs of the few don’t outweigh the needs of the many!
JOHN
Very well, I guess I’ll just have to MAKE you see our side of things! Engage the Star Harvester’s Weapons Platform!


JAUGHN
This is it! Get ready everyone!


Gameplay (Final Boss: Phase 1)


JOHN
Grr… there’s more of you flies to swat than I thought. 


JAUGHN
It’s over, fake Jaughn! 


JOHN
Over? It’s not over until all of you are dead![ab] Even if I fall here, the star’s implosion will take care of the entire rebellion at once!


EBB
We don’t have much time. He’s right. Let’s FINISH this!


Gameplay (Final Boss: Phase 2)[ac]


JAUGHN
You still have time to surrender, don’t make this worse on yourself!


JOHN
I have no plans to surrender to the likes of you. Our plans are bigger than either of us, and I’ll make sure I see it through!
Final Boss is Defeated
JOHN
Urgh… I may fall here, but the Coalition’s work will continue. You can kill the man but not the idea… one day you’ll see! Augh…
JAUGHN
Phew… the fight’s over. But, the star is still in danger of an implosion.
EBB
We have but a few precious minutes to reverse the process. If we return the harvested plasma to the star, its mass may stabilize.

APOLLO
Is there a reverse switch on this hunk of junk?


EBB
No… but we can make one. It will result in the destruction of the star harvester…
REBEKAH
Oh, good-


EBB
…and likely us, but countless lives will be saved.

REBEKAH
Oh.
EBB
There is, however, a slim chance of 0.00005435% that we can escape in time. No pressure.
JAUGHN
If it avoids this star blowing up countless systems, then it’s worth the risk. Otherwise, it was an honor to meet all of you.
APOLLO
Ah man… I guess we don’t have a choice huh? We’ll have to take those odds.

REBEKAH
I’ll plot the fastest course out of here. Ebb, start the reversal process once you receive the coordinates.
EBB
Coordinates received. Beginning the reversal process now. 

JAUGHN
Everyone! Punch it, now!
The Rebellion crew begins their heroic escape sequence. In the process, the star harvester begins buckling and shaking under the pressure of the plasma being sent back into the star. Within sheer moments, it starts exploding and falling apart.
APOLLO

We’re not going to make it! It was nice knowing you all!
JAUGHN
We have to make it! We have to!
[PIZZA JINGLE PLAYS]
PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER
Quick!! No time to explain! We set up a hyperspace slingshot to help you!
REBEKAH
Wait, what?? HOW’D YOU GET THIS THING???
PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER
How do you think I get across the galaxy so quickly? Now move!
JAUGHN
There’s no time! All ships! Into the slingshot now!
Over the course of a few seconds, the rebels all pilot their ships through the slingshot, sending them through hyperspace safely out of the explosion’s path, narrowly avoiding destruction.


JAUGHN
My heart is pounding… we did it, everyone!
[Everyone cheers]
EBB
We made it… but I didn’t get to watch the B O O M…
APOLLO
Ah geez, just be grateful you’re alive, bucket-head!


REBEKAH
We accomplished an amazing feat today. Good work everyone!


Act Three Scene 5 - Peace at Last


With the galaxy now saved from the threat of annihilation, the rebels celebrate their heroic victory back at their base. Talk of what to do next emerges, after the celebrations conclude.
REBEKAH
With John dead, there’s still splinter groups of the Coalition to take care of. We could use your help still. What do you say, Captain?
JAUGHN
Listen, I appreciate the offer. But I think after the whole “narrowly avoid dying to save the galaxy” situation I need a break. I also think my cat misses me. I’m going home.
APOLLO
I hate to see ya go buddy… you’ll be back though, right?


JAUGHN
If the galaxy’s threatened again, you guys can count on me. I’ll see you around.


EBB
Sniff Oh… I think I’m feeling something called “emotions.” I don’t like it.


REBEKAH
Goodbye Jaughn! You were the best Captain we ever had.
[The rebels give Jaughn a round of applause]
Jaughn takes one last look at his new friends, then hops in his ship to leave. He waves everyone off, including the new members of the rebellion who joined for the last battle. He knew the galaxy was in good hands, and he could return to his home to enjoy some peace… for now.
[THE END]
[a]Jaughn character arc so far:
Surprised at his skills-- they survived that!
Starting to get competent
Starting to believe in himself
[b]how does Jaughn feel about this?
[c]Probably both honored and scared - being the captain means that he's the one responsible for the ship's safety and the success of the missions, and he barely joined the rebellion like a month ago tops (I imagine the story is faster than that, but that's my guesstimate for biggest stretch of time).
[d]the crew sees the need for a captain in order to stand a chance at completing such a difficult mission and john has been doing a great job as their stand in captain so they put their trust in him to be their captain for this final mission
[e]art team-make background characters???
[f](start with a single re-usable model...)
[g]Jaughn realizing that he can have some self confidence and is capable of leading the crew
[h]now time to talk about a game plan :0
[i]Jaughn needs a point that's close to the Coalition but far enough that they won't be detected
Ebb scans tghe satellite info for a good point
Ebb and Rebekah find the point on a map
Apollo helps Jaughn set-up the warp
Boom. they're ready!
[j]now time to talk about a game plan :0
[k]Jaughn needs a point that's close to the Coalition but far enough that they won't be detected
Ebb scans tghe satellite info for a good point
Ebb and Rebekah find the point on a map
Apollo helps Jaughn set-up the warp
Boom. they're ready!
[l]should the pizza delivery guy pull up
[m]Story wise, understandable. What force were we using before though?
[n]Cue Avengers theme
[o]ask design about their plans for the levels in ACT 3
[p]Music team-this can either be just a sound effect or a line in the narration along with a sound effect.
[q]Since the audience already knows this this might seem a little redundant.
[r]the pizza guy wants to fight too. He has pizza
[s]come up with slang that fits with the space theming-
[t]Maybe think of some type of weird alien thing or a galaxy of some sort. Remember the original phrase is referencing something weird or obscure for instance "What in the ass crack of Miley Cyrus is going on here?!" You could even tie in something really adult while masking it with clever wording for instance instead of saying "cluster fuck" we can say what in the  like "what in the Clingon's Cluster Flyby" is that thing?
[u]this is our plot twist. Should we do anything else to set it up? How dramatic do we want it to be? How can we make it more funny?
[v]Should we mention John before this? Or is it more funny not to? I think it would be funny to have a "middle sibling" dynamic with John that they barely mention him to Jaughn
[w]what is john's evil plan: john wanted to lure the rebellion and any of its supporters to one place in order to destroy all of them with the sun explosion in order to erase any evidence of the original resource mining operation so that there are no opponents to the cooperation.
[x]In order to set up the plot twist a little more I think we should introduce a little bit of mystery/questions in order to have Evil John play a little more of a role in the story. What if instead of John/Jaughn mix-up happening because of the wrong cell number, it was intentional? If John is a double agent for the coalition, they would not have him there at the jail, they could use a random nobody like Jaughn fill in his cell and when the crew comes and breaks him out, there's a confusion about why it's not the crew's original captain. Evil John had set it up from the beginning.
[y]What if Evil John talks to the radio host guy after the first radio station is captured?
[z]let's be careful to not undermine John as a threat too!
[aa]The idea to radio station and then go to the star was Jaughn's idea, so this would be a bit false.
[ab]rewrite character dialogue when we understand evil John's character a little more
[ac]I think all bosses are 1 stage.
