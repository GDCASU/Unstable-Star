Gameplay starts (start of lvl 1)Textbox:


APOLLO


You ready, new guy? Here comes the first wave of security drones! 


REBEKAH
Just remember how to fly the ship we gave you and you’ll be fine!


EBB


I will be watching for the B O O M S. Don’t disappoint me. 


JAUGHN
I’ll… I’ll do my best.

BREAK


Gameplay (after they clear the first satellite (lvl 1)) Textbox:
JAUGHN
Phew, that got a little hairy.


APOLLO
Ebb, you got that satellite up and running?


EBB
Affirmative. That satellite is now as useless to the Coalition as a wet sack of gunpowder. 


REBEKAH
I’m plotting our course to the next satellite. It won’t take long for the Coalition to respond to us.


BREAK

DESC: 
The scene transitions to the Coalition Headquarters. A grunt approaches a large, shadowy figure.


COALITION GRUNT
Sir, uh, we’ve detected a problem. One of our communication satellites in the Gamma-K3 Sector has been compromised.


SHADOWY FIGURE
…Hmm… Any sign the rebels are behind it?


COALITION GRUNT
It’s too early to tell for sure, but we believe so, sir.


SHADOWY FIGURE
…Get our communications director on the line. Tell him not to allow the rebels to take the remaining satellites, or there will be consequences.


BREAK

Gameplay (start of lvl 2)Textbox:
REBEKAH
We’re in range of the second satellite!
APOLLO
Ah great, they got more goons here. Well, time to get blastin’!


EBB
H e h e h e. I can’t wait to try out my new Protokol Laser Mk. 3 on them. 


JAUGHN
Ah great… here we go again!






BREAK

Gameplay (after they clear the second satellite (lvl 2) )Textbox:


EBB
The second satellite is now under our control. I’m seeing Coalition signals light up across the board. The next battle might get a little crazy. E X C E L L E N T.


REBEKAH
No! Not excellent! There’s a giant fleet of Coalition ships translating into the sector!
APOLLO
We’ve made it this far, no backing down now! Right, Jaughn?


JAUGHN
Y-Yeah, right. H-haha. 


BREAK

DESC: 
The scene transitions to the Coalition Headquarters. The large, shadowy figure from before is seen in a control room.


SHADOWY FIGURE
You have failed to prevent them from taking the second satellite. I’m assigning you to deal with the rebels personally. 


Radio Station DJ
But sir… I’m just a radio host.


SHADOWY FIGURE
Oh really? Last I checked you were also our communications director. Do not fail me, or your life will be forfeit.


Radio Station DJ
Ah… yes sir. It’s time to rock.

BREAK
