Urgh… I’ve been taken off the air…


EBB
With that obnoxious yuppie out of the way, we now have control over all three satellites.


REBEKAH
We did it, everyone!


JAUGHN
I can’t believe we survived that! 


APOLLO
Hell yeah!! Ya did good keeping up with us out there!


JAUGHN
Oh shucks. I just tried to stay alive!


REBEKAH
Now we can broadcast our message-


EBB
Hold on. I’m still getting some Coalition communications attempting to pass through this network. Let’s eavesdrop, shall we?

*CRRSSHH* Everything is going according to plan. Our Star Harvester will begin harvesting the hypergiant star in the Apex-12 System. Our benefactors will be very pleased!




REBEKAH
…Hypergiant star?? Those are incredibly unstable! Don’t they realize that harvesting the plasma could cause a hypernova??


APOLLO
These maniacs are going to blow up the star! That would take out most of the galaxy!!


EBB
As much as I would enjoy the V E R Y  B I G  B O O M, it would seem our next objective is set.


JAUGHN
I can’t believe this… so many people live in that system. Do they not care at all?


REBEKAH
Now you understand what’s at stake. The Coalition stopped caring about the consequences of their actions a long time ago.


JAUGHN
We have to stop them! Let’s get a message out across the galaxy!


EBB
Initializing broadcast…


[Broadcast Message]
Attention all Milky Way citizens! Your Intragalactic Coalition has failed you! They’re planning on harvesting the plasma from the hypergiant star in the Apex-12 System! This would threaten the entire system and have untold consequences for the whole galaxy! Their unending quest for natural resources will result in YOUR death! If you’re brave enough to fight for your freedom, join the Rebellion! All capable fighters, meet us at Proximus-3 in the Apex-12 System!
JAUGHN
(inner monologue)
Now we just hope our message didn’t fall on deaf ears… this next battle could be our last.
DESC: 
The message rang loud and clear across communications devices everywhere in the galaxy. The crew of the Rebellion hoped their message wouldn’t fall on deaf ears. They knew the next battle could very well be their last…
