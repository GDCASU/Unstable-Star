Gameplay*( Lvl 1: the crew clears the route to Proximus 3)


After Gameplay


DESC: 
Meanwhile, the large, shadowy figure from before is seen boarding a ship for the Apex-12 System. 


SHADOWY FIGURE
So, that’s their plan then. They’ll all be gathered in one place… taking care of them will be easy. Nothing will threaten the Coalition’s plans.


Act Three Scene 3- The Path Ahead
DESC: 
With the Coalition’s security force out of the way, the area around Proximus 3’s orbit is now clear. The crew sat patrolling around the moon, waiting for anyone who might have heard their message…


APOLLO


So this is it, huh? Doesn’t look like anyone’s showing up.


REBEKAH
Patience isn’t your strong suit, Apollo. They’ll get here. I’m sure of it…


JAUGHN
If even just a few people show up, we’ll be all the better for it.


DESC: 
A few moments pass. Suddenly, the crew hear the beeping of their radar.
NOISE
*BEEP* *BEEP*
EBB


I’m picking up several signals approaching us. They’re… not Coalition signals. Opening comms. 




DESC: 
One by one, random civilian crafts start warping into the sector. Doctors, farmers, chefs, politicians, people from all walks of life are here. Even… [Pizza delivery theme] pizza delivery drivers…
BREAK

PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER
Hey guys! Are we late? I hope not, I don’t want to lose my tip.


JAUGHN
YOU?! What are you doing here?! You got me arrested!!


PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER
Wait, really? Sorry about that, my friend. I just saw a fight comin’ on, and since the Coalition keeps taking my tip money, I decided to help out. Let me make it up to you! Anyone order a side of GUNS?
DESC: 
The delivery sign on the roof of his ship transforms into a gun. The other ships prepare their weapons, as well. 


Random Civilian
We’re here to fight too!


Mathematically Predictable Civilian
Got your message!


JAUGHN
Thank you, everyone! With your help, we can win this!


EBB
I’m picking up the Coalition’s signal near the hypergiant star. The ship they have there is… massive. Damage to the star is ongoing.


REBEKAH
I’m navigating us there now. Everyone, follow us and prepare to fight!
