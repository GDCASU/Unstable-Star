Gameplay*( Lvl 1: the crew clears the route to Proximus 3)



DESC: 
Meanwhile, the large, shadowy figure from before is seen boarding a ship for the Apex-12 System. 


SHADOWY FIGURE
So, that’s their plan then. They’ll all be gathered in one place… taking care of them will be easy. Nothing will threaten the Coalition’s plans.

Act Three Scene 3- The Path Ahead
DESC: 
With the Coalition’s security force out of the way, the area around Proximus 3’s orbit is now clear. The crew sat patrolling around the moon, waiting for anyone who might have heard their message…


APOLLO


So this is it, huh? Doesn’t look like anyone’s showing up.


REBEKAH
Patience isn’t your strong suit, Apollo. They’ll get here. I’m sure of it…


JAUGHN
If even just a few people show up, we’ll be all the better for it.


DESC: 
A few moments pass. Suddenly, the crew hear the beeping of their radar.
NOISE
*BEEP* *BEEP*
EBB


I’m picking up several signals approaching us. They’re… not Coalition signals. Opening comms. 



BREAK
DESC: 
One by one, random civilian crafts start warping into the sector. 
Doctors, farmers, chefs, politicians, people from all walks of life are here. 
Even… pizza delivery drivers…

NOISE
pizza theme

PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER
Hey guys! Are we late? I hope not, I don’t want to lose my tip.


JAUGHN
YOU?! What are you doing here?! You got me arrested!!


PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER
Wait, really? Sorry about that, my friend. I just saw a fight comin’ on, and since the Coalition keeps taking my tip money, I decided to help out. Let me make it up to you! Anyone order a side of GUNS?
DESC: 
The delivery sign on the roof of his ship transforms into a gun. The other ships prepare their weapons, as well. 


Random Civilian
We’re here to fight too!


Mathematically Predictable Civilian
Got your message!


JAUGHN
Thank you, everyone! With your help, we can win this!


EBB
I’m picking up the Coalition’s signal near the hypergiant star. The ship they have there is… massive. Damage to the star is ongoing.


REBEKAH
I’m navigating us there now. Everyone, follow us and prepare to fight!

BREAK
Gameplay ( lvl 2: the Rebellion and crew have to fight their way to the giant Coalition ship)

Act Three Scene 4 - The Final Battle (The Johnening)
DESC: 
The Rebellion crew, with the civilian fighters in tow, have cleared their way to the hypergiant star in the center of the system. A giant, vacuum-like mechanical ship can be seen orbiting around it, sucking in plasma from the star.


JAUGHN
What in blazars IS that thing??


APOLLO


It’s… sucking the energy out of the star like some kind of giant vacuum!


EBB
The star is incredibly unstable. An implosion… followed by a B I G BOOM is imminent. 


REBEKAH
We need to figure out a way to destroy it now or it will be too late!


DESC: 
The fighters cautiously but urgently approach the giant ship. Their comms are suddenly interrupted by a strangely familiar voice…
JOHN
Intruders, you are hereby ordered to surrender or be destroyed. You have caused untold damage to the Coalition. I won’t ask again.


APOLLO
Wait… that voice. I know that voice.


REBEKAH
What the f- JOHN? 


JAUGHN
Me?


REBEKAH
No!


EBB
The previous Captain? He’s still alive?


JOHN
Oh yes. Did you think I would be killed so easily?


APOLLO


Yeah, we thought you were dead! What are you doing working for the Coalition??


JAUGHN
Wait, who is this? I’m the Captain now, identify yourself!


JOHN
Oh you poor fools, you didn’t tell him? I’m John, the REAL Captain, and you bought my act hook, line, and sinker. 
I was simply undercover in your little club, so deep undercover in fact that I pretended to get arrested! 
Your path here was entirely staged by me. I arranged for Jaughn to be put in my cell. 
It was by my hand that you rescued this… faker instead of me.


JAUGHN
Faker?? Wait a minute, I think you’re the fake Jaughn here!


JOHN
And now you’ve brought the entire rebellion here. You’ve fallen right into my trap. 
Our weapon here has absorbed enough solar plasma to kill you all in one blast. 
And once you’re gone, peace will be restored to the galaxy.


APOLLO

Peace?? You call this peace??


JOHN
Yes, order leads to peace. You have done nothing but undermine our order, which has led to chaos. 
Don’t you realize the coalition maintains our fragile relationship with our neighboring galaxy?


JAUGHN
I once believed in that lie, but you’re all just a bunch of greedy hacks who will stop at nothing to keep your sham of a relationship going. 
What good is “order” when you’re killing innocent civilians??


JOHN
I guess you’re too short-sighted to realize that the ends justify the means. The Coalition has led to the betterment of mankind, and our benefactors desperately need this star’s plasma. 
We are simply here to provide.


REBEKAH
But by harvesting the plasma, you’re going to blow up the star! You’re going to cause countless deaths throughout the galaxy! 
The needs of the few don’t outweigh the needs of the many!


JOHN
Very well, I guess I’ll just have to MAKE you see our side of things! Engage the Star Harvester’s Weapons Platform!


JAUGHN
This is it! Get ready everyone!


Gameplay (Final Boss: Phase 1)


JOHN
Grr… there’s more of you flies to swat than I thought. 


JAUGHN
It’s over, fake Jaughn! 


JOHN
Over? It’s not over until all of you are dead! Even if I fall here, the star’s implosion will take care of the entire rebellion at once!


EBB
We don’t have much time. He’s right. Let’s FINISH this!


Gameplay (Final Boss: Phase 2)


JAUGHN
You still have time to surrender, don’t make this worse on yourself!


JOHN
I have no plans to surrender to the likes of you. Our plans are bigger than either of us, and I’ll make sure I see it through!
