Act Three Scene 2 - Dark Clouds Swirl
THE ABANDONED COALITION FACTORY - AWAY SYSTEM
The ships warp into the Away System one by one, translating into an open sector near the abandoned factory Ebb discovered. 
Heaps of debris of destroyed homes and civilian ships litter the area surrounding the factory. 
It floats there in the cold stillness of space. The crew is stunned and silent.

What is all this? What happened here?




APOLLO
NORMAL
…These are civilian ships and stations… They’re all destroyed…


REBEKAH
NORMAL
No survivors, either. They’re all dead.

The Coalition must’ve silenced all opposition to build this factory here. 
And now it’s just left abandoned to litter this sector anyway. What a waste.


JAUGHN
SAD
I used to believe the Coalition was a force for good in our galaxy… I can’t believe this.


EBB
SAD
And so it falls to us to avenge their deaths. Do you have any inspiring words, Captain?

Our next battle is quickly approaching, everyone. The Coalition has taken from people their homes, their families, their livelihoods. 
If we don’t stop them, countless lives will continue to be lost. If the Coalition is out for blood, we need to do whatever we can to stop them and avenge these deaths. 


APOLLO
NORMAL
Looks like we don’t have a choice, huh… We need to clear a path to Proximus-3, or those fighters will be killed, too.


REBEKAH
NORMAL
We’ll have each other, especially if we get the additional backup. We’re a team.

Now you’re talking, let me get out the B I G  G U N S.
