Act Three Scene 1 - Things are getting serious…


INT. REBELLION’S SPACE STATION
DESC: 
We open with our crew returning to their space station, preparing for what lays ahead of them. 
JAUGHN
I’m still in disbelief that we survived that.


APOLLO


That was amazing Jaughn! We took over those tin cans like it was nothin’!




REBEKAH
I must admit, that went better than I thought it would.


JAUGHN
Oh, well, it was all thanks to you guys. I just came up with the plan.


EBB
…And blew up that annoying Radio host. Don’t forget the way you made him EXPLODE. B O O M!




APOLLO
It wasn’t just planning! You showed some real leadership skills if you ask me. Right, guys?


REBEKAH
Ah, heck. Might as well admit it. We’re still in need of a Captain, and we’ve been doing well so far with you. 


JAUGHN
…Captain? Me?


APOLLO


Yeah, no need to be modest about it, my guy. We’ve got the biggest battle yet ahead of us, and we need someone to lead us.


EBB


Section 15, Article 2, Subsection 12 of the Anti-Coalition Rebellion Code says that we have the right to nominate a new Captain in the event the old Captain is unable to perform their duties. 
All in favor of nominating Jaughn as the new Captain?


[All in Unison]
Aye!


EBB


And there we have it. Jaughn is our new Captain moving forward!




DESC: 
The three leaders and the rest of the Rebellion gave Jaughn a round of applause. 
Jaughn looked around and suddenly felt a level of respect emanating from everyone looking at him.
NOISE
*applause* 
JAUGHN
(Inner monologue)
Wow, looking around, I can feel everyone’s admiration. Me? Captain? I’m not used to feeling this important… Perhaps I could be more than a lowly Border Guard after all…


DESC: 
Jaughn felt his confidence rise, until he decided to speak:


JAUGHN
Thank you everyone for placing your trust in me as your Captain! I won’t let you down.
 
APOLLO


I’m sure you won’t, Captain!


REBEKAH
Now we need to figure out a plan to make it to the Apex-12 System. That entire System is under Coalition control.


EBB


And they’re going to be looking for us, after we sent out that message.


JAUGHN
We need to figure out a blind spot in the Coalition’s defenses. Somewhere they’re not watching in that system. Ebb, do we still have the satellites’ data?


EBB


Yes. I will begin scanning the 5 yottabytes of retrieved satellite data for clues. This will take a while.


JAUGHN
I’m remembering something from my training… Skip ahead to anything mentioning the Delta-X5 Sector. That was our codename for the Apex-12 System.


EBB
Got it. Here’s something interesting. “Abandonment of the Delta X5 Munitions Factory.” It seems an engine core failure caused the permanent shutdown of that factory. All Coalition presence pulled out afterwards. It’s on the outskirts of the system.


REBEKAH
I’m plotting a course now. That could give us a way in without being noticed.


APOLLO
…and then we can clear a path to Proximus-3 for the other fighters!


JAUGHN
Alright, we have a plan. Let’s move everyone!


DESC: 
The Rebellion’s ships are quickly scrambled and everyone prepares to warp to the Apex-12 System.

BREAK
