Act Two Scene 1 - Here’s the plan
REBELLION’S SPACE STATION
We start inside the Rebellion’s Base. Jaughn, having formally joined the Rebellion, is touring the base with the three leaders. 


APOLLO
…And over here we have our munitions storage. Ebb likes that room a lot.


JAUGHN
ANGRY
Wait, are those Coalition guns? Where’d those come from? 
EBB
NORMAL
Ooh, we got those from our last Coalition Raid. That was a fun battle! We stopped those leeches before they could take over another planet.
 
JAUGHN
ANGRY
Take over another planet? Wait, why would the Coalition do that?


REBEKAH
NORMAL
Well… if you haven’t noticed the Coalition has stepped way out of line. 


APOLLO


After first contact with the Triangulum Galaxy, they established this “Peace Accord” with my home to link the two galaxies. 
That’s when I joined the Coalition… before I knew those corrupt brutes were destroying planets to keep it going.


REBEKAH
It’s a classic case of corruption. The Coalition is getting advanced tech and science from the Triangulum aliens, while the aliens are getting our natural resources. 
Neither side wants that relationship to fail, so they’ll do it at any cost. 
APOLLO


My home galaxy was a barren wasteland, before the Accord got started. But… they’re destroying the Milky Way galaxy in the process. 
Before long, this galaxy will look like mine did. There’s gotta be a better way.
 
JAUGHN
SAD
I had no idea. I thought they were crazy for sending me to jail over letting a pizza guy through, but I didn’t know it was this bad.
APOLLO
They’re damn good at maintaining their “good guy” public image and covering up anything that could expose what they’re doing. 
Keep the catchy tunes on the radio, while the voices in need of hearing go unheard. 


EBB
NORMAL
Which is exactly why we need to make our move before they act again. Can you elaborate on the Coalition’s satellites?


JAUGHN
Okay, so here’s the deal: the Coalition’s signal is split between three major satellite stations. They’re set up to rely on each other as a failsafe. 
If one goes down, the others won’t cooperate. In short, we need to control all three to control the signal.


REBEKAH
I’m plotting a course to the first satellite. It looks like the Coalition is keeping a heavy security presence around it. 
Are these things more important than you’re letting on?


EBB
Since these satellites reach most of the galaxy, it could double as their central communication network. It would make sense to heavily fortify them.


APOLLO
HAPPY
No problem, we’ll just blast our way through!


REBEKAH
NORMAL
Once we reach the first satellite, Ebb will hack into the main systems. 
We’ll have a limited amount of time to make it to the other satellites before the Coalition realizes what we’re doing.
APOLLO


Everyone, to your ships!

DESC: 
After traveling for a while, the crew reaches the outskirts of the K-COAL network’s first broadcasting station. 
It was orbiting around a planet that’s been converted into a massive Coalition factory. 
The civilians that had lived here were forced out several Earth years ago. Out here, there are just old floating billboard stations and space debris.  




EBB


We’ve arrived at the first broadcasting station.


JAUGHN
ANGRY
Whoa! It looks like no one’s touched this in a billion years….




EBB
NORMAL
Actually, if it had been a billion years, this system’s star would have expanded and swallowed this place.


REBEKAH
There were people living here… but they were forced out in favor of setting up this massive Coalition factory… No room for the little guy.


JAUGHN
SAD
Damn…

BREAK
hahha
