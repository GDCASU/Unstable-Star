Act Two Scene 1 - Here’s the plan
INT. REBELLION’S SPACE STATION
We start inside the Rebellion’s Base. Jaughn, having formally joined the Rebellion, is touring the base with the three leaders[a]. 


APOLLO
…And over here we have our munitions cache. Ebb likes that room a lot.


JAUGHN
Wait, are those Coalition guns? Where’d those come from? 
EBB


Ooh, we got those from our last Coalition Raid. That was a fun battle! We stopped those goons[b][c][d][e] before they could take over another planet.
 
JAUGHN
Take over another planet? Wait, why would the Coalition do that?


REBEKAH
Well… if you haven’t noticed the Coalition has stepped way out of line. 


APOLLO
Those corrupt [f][g]bbastards started destroying planets to maintain this “Peace Accord” with the [aliens][h][i].


REBEKAH
It’s a classic case of corruption. The Coalition is getting advanced tech from the [aliens], while the [aliens] are getting our natural resources. Neither side wants that relationship to fail.
JAUGHN
I had no idea. I thought they were crazy for sending me to jail over letting a pizza guy through, but I didn’t know it was this bad.
APOLLO
They’re damn good at maintaining their “good guy” public image and covering up anything that could expose what they’re doing. Keep the catchy tunes on the radio, while the voices in need of hearing go unheard. 


EBB
Which is exactly why we need to make our move before they act again. Can you elaborate on the Coalition’s satellites?


JAUGHN
Okay, so here’s the deal: The Coalition’s signal is split between three major satellite stations. They’re set up to rely on each other as a failsafe. If one goes down, the others won’t cooperate. In short, we need to control all three to control the signal.


REBEKAH
I’m plotting a course to the first satellite. It looks like the Coalition is keeping a heavy security presence around it. Are these things more important than you’re letting on?


EBB
Since these satellites reach most of the galaxy, it could double as their central communication network. It would make sense to heavily fortify them.


APOLLO


No problem, we’ll just blast our way through!


REBEKAH
Once we reach the first satellite, Ebb will hack into the main systems. We’ll have a limited amount of time to make it to the other satellites before the Coalition realizes what we’re doing.
APOLLO


Everyone, to your ships!




After traveling for a while, the crew reaches the outskirts of the K-COAL network’s first broadcasting station. It was orbiting around a planet that’s been converted into a massive Coalition factory. No civilians had lived here in several Earth years. Out here, there are just old floating billboard stations and space debris.  


Gameplay starts (start of lvl 1)


Textbox:


APOLLO


You ready, new guy? Here comes the first wave of security drones! 


REBEKAH
Just remember how to fly the ship we gave you and you’ll be fine!


EBB


I will be watching for the B O O M S. Don’t disappoint me. 


JAUGHN
I’ll… I’ll do my best.




Gameplay (after they clear the first satellite (lvl 1))


Textbox:
JAUGHN
Phew, that got a little hairy.


APOLLO
Ebb, you got that satellite up and running?


EBB
Affirmative. That satellite is now as useless to the Coalition as a wet sack of gunpowder. 


REBEKAH
I’m plotting our course to the next satellite. It won’t take long for the Coalition to respond to us.


The scene transitions to the Coalition Headquarters. A grunt approaches a large, shadowy figure.


COALITION GRUNT
Sir, uh, we’ve detected a problem. One of our communication satellites in the Gamma-K3 Sector has been compromised.


SHADOWY FIGURE
…Hmm… Any sign the rebels are behind it?


COALITION GRUNT
It’s too early to tell for sure, but we believe so, sir.


SHADOWY FIGURE
…Get our communications director on the line. Tell him not to allow the rebels to take the remaining satellites, or there will be consequences.




Gameplay (start of lvl 2)


Textbox:
REBEKAH
We’re in range of the second satellite!
APOLLO
Ah great, they got more goons here. Well, time to get blastin’!


EBB
H e h e h e. I can’t wait to try out my new Protokol Laser Mk. 3 on them. 


JAUGHN
Ah great… here we go again!








Gameplay (after they clear the second satellite (lvl 2) )


Textbox:


EBB
The second satellite is now under our control. I’m seeing Coalition signals light up across the board. The next battle might get a little crazy. E X C E L L E N T.


REBEKAH
No! Not excellent! There’s a giant fleet of Coalition ships translating into the sector!
APOLLO
We’ve made it this far, no backing down now! Right, Jaungh


JAUGHN
Y-Yeah, right. H-haha. 


The scene transitions to the Coalition Headquarters. The large, shadowy figure from before is seen in a control room.


SHADOWY FIGURE
You have failed to prevent them from taking the second satellite. I’m assigning you to deal with the rebels personally. 


Radio Station DJ
But sir… I’m just a radio host.


SHADOWY FIGURE
Oh really? Last I checked you were also our communications director. Do not fail me, or your life will be forfeit.


Radio Station DJ
Ah… yes sir. It’s time to rock.[j]






Arcade Game 
Act Two Scene 2 - Guerilla Radio (lvl 3)


EXT. OUTSIDE THE THIRD K-COAL RADIO STATION


We see the crew approaching the third radio station. The space around the radio station is incredibly busy with enemy ships. They’ve clearly upped their security. In the center is one massive ship piloted by… a DJ? (cue music)[k]


Radio Station DJ
Not very righteous of you, dudes. We’ll be taking back our bodacious satellites now.
APOLLO
Oh brother, this guy is trying too hard to sound cool.


JAUGHN
Oh man, is that [DJ Name][l][m][n] in the Morning? I used to listen to his show all the time!


Radio Station DJ
Don’t think we haven’t noticed you bogarting on our turf. You have exactly one commercial break to lay down your weapons before I drop the beat![o]
REBEKAH
Uh… well this is not what I was expecting. …Where’s that music coming from? (music gets louder)[p]
EBB
It’s coming from the DJ’s ship in the center of the fleet. Let’s turn this boombox into a B O O M box!


APOLLO
He’s coming right at us! Strap in, guys!


Radio Station DJ
Let’s rock!!




Arcade Game 
Act Two Scene 3 - System: Downed (lvl 3)


EXT. OUTSIDE THE THIRD K-COAL RADIO STATION


Radio Station DJ
Urgh… I’ve been taken off the air…


EBB
With that obnoxious yuppie out of the way, we now have control over all three satellites.


REBEKAH
We did it, everyone!


JAUGHN
I can’t believe we survived that! 


APOLLO
Of course we did, we had you on our side didn’t we?[q][r]


JAUGHN
Oh shucks. I just tried to stay alive!


REBEKAH
Now we can broadcast our message-


EBB
Hold on. I’m still getting some Coalition communications attempting to pass through this network. Let’s eavesdrop, shall we?


[Network Transmission]
(CRRSSHH…[s]) Everything is going according to plan. Our Star Harvester will begin harvesting the hypergiant star in the [Away][t][u] System. Our benefactors will be very pleased!


REBEKAH
…Hypergiant star[v][w]?? Those are incredibly unstable![x] Don’t they realize that harvesting the plasma could cause a hypernova??


APOLLO
These maniacs are going to blow up the star! That would take out most of the galaxy!!


EBB
As much as I would enjoy the V E R Y  B I G  B O O M, it would seem our next objective is set.


JAUGHN
I can’t believe this… so many people live in that system. Do they not care at all?


REBEKAH
Now you understand what’s at stake. The Coalition stopped caring about the consequences of their actions a long time ago.


JAUGHN
We have to stop them! Let’s get a message out across the galaxy!


EBB
Initializing broadcast…


[Broadcast Message]
Attention all [galaxy][y] citizens! Your Intragalactic Coalition has failed you! They’re planning on harvesting the plasma from the hypergiant star in the [Away] System! This would blow up the entire system and have untold consequences for the galaxy![z] Their unending quest for natural resources will result in YOUR death! If you’re brave enough to fight for your freedom, join the Rebellion! All capable fighters, meet us at [Proximus 3][aa][ab] in the [Away] System!


The message rang loud and clear across communications devices everywhere in the galaxy. The crew of the Rebellion hoped their message wouldn’t fall on deaf ears. They knew the next battle could very well be their last…
End of Act Two
[a]What do they individually lead. why are there 3 leaders. This was mentioned at the end of the last act too (I commented there) but there's no real explanation as to why they're being called leaders.
[b]come up with a better insult? lol
[c]"meat sacks'?
[d]clankers
[e]Imperial leeches, tyrants, cosmic virus, galactic oppressors. I think playing into Ebb being a robot w/ the insults would be funny.
[f]better insults, maybe?
[g]Apollo seems like the decent level-headed guy of the ship, so his insults would probably be something straightforward like this is
[h]Come up with a name for the alien galaxy?
[i]Zanglebob Empire
[j]fun undertale text
[k]note for sound team
[l]DJ Name? Ideas: Rude Rudy, Treble Make-R
[m]Jawn Keenston
[n]like john kingston, but spelled bad
[o]fun text! Kinda like undertale
[p]note for sound team
[q]Isn't Jaughn still technically a rookie?
[r]I think Apollo has some sort of affinity for Jaughn. But I digress a little more sarcasm in this line would be more fitting.
[s]sound effect!
[t]Name for Away System? (Second Solar System)
[u]Dikillion (die kill ee un). so like di as in 2, kill as in going to die, ion to make it sound good
[v]should we name the star?
[w]meh
[x]Evil plan:  The coalition is putting hundreds of thousands of lives at risk for their own gain and the crew must stop them before they continue their mining/testing efforts on the hypergiant star they are trying to get resources from!
[y]Galaxy name?
[z]make sure to convey the consequence of the thingy
[aa]Planet/Moon name?
[ab]Proximus 3 actually kinda slaps
