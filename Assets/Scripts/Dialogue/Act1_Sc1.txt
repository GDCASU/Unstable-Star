INT. JAUGHN’S JAIL CELL 


DESC: 
We open in a white and sterile jail cell. Everything is clean and well kept. Everything is perfect. We see a solemn young man is slumped over in his cell. Sitting on the edge of his bed, he ponders how he got here.
JAUGHN
NORMAL
(Inner monologue)
How long has it been? The Coalition… it feels like it's been ages since they arrested me.
……
Sure, maybe I shouldn’t have let that pizza driver cross the border… But come on! I get half a lifetime in jail for that?


This is ridiculous…
But…

NOISE
*The intercom buzzes.*
JAUGHN
…
…?!

NOISE
*buzzes*

JAUGHN
What…
What is that noise?


REBEKAH
???
…
Ca… tain…


JAUGHN
NORMAL
Is that coming from…
The broadcasting system?


REBEKAH
???
He… llo?
Hello? Can you hear me?
Apollo, is the frequency tuned? Are we broadcasting yet?


APOLLO
NORMAL
Yup! The whole prison can hear us, Rebekah!


REBEKAH

Captain!
Don’t worry, Captain! We’re coming to get you!


JAUGHN
Captain…?


APOLLO

Alright, Ebb, we’re ready!


EBB

The charge on Cell B3 is ready. Explosion imminent.
Proceed?


APOLLO

Proceed!
Get ready to blow this sucker up!


EBB


Affirmative.


JAUGHN
What is going on?!




APOLLO


DETONATE!

NOISE
*BOOM* *BOOM* *BOOM*  [Insert Explosion SFX] 
DESC: 
An explosion punches into the hull of the prison, blasting off the cell door and leaving a visible dent in the nearby wall. As the entire structure shakes [camera shake], pieces of the building crumble from above. 


JAUGHN
Augh! What was that? What’s happening!?
NOISE
*RUMBLE**RUMBLE**RUMBLE*


JAUGHN
WHOA!! I can’t stand-
DESC: 
Jaughn’s footing becomes noticeably unsteady, struggling to keep his feet on the ground.
JAUGHN
(Inner monologue)
What’s that sound? It’s getting closer… is that a ship?
NOISE
[Spaceship	crashing SFX]


REBEKAH
Wait, who is this? This isn’t the Captain!! Apollo, I thought you said B3?!




APOLLO


It WAS B3! We were told cell B3! I blew up CELL B3!




EBB
How did we get it wrong? 


REBEKAH
There’s no way! I double-checked! This MUST be the right cell! Maybe you didn’t follow my directions!


APOLLO

I DID follow your directions! YOU’RE obviously the one who was wrong, because this guy ain’t the Captain!


REBEKAH
Oh shut up! You couldn’t navigate your way out of a cardboard box!
APOLLO
HEY-!


EBB

Wait. Guys.


APOLLO


Well maybe, if you weren’t so SMELLY, WE WOULDN’T-


REBEKAH
QUIT IT WITH THAT! I showered LAST WEEK, moron.


EBB
G u y s.
L o o k.


JAUGHN
Ugh…
What… is going on?


SECURITY DEFENSE SYSTEM


ALERT! CELL BREACH DETECTED!


EBB


The Captain is not present.
Their systems have detected us. We need to get out of here now.


JAUGHN
Wait, take me with you! Get me out of here!


REBEKAH

Why? Can you fly a ship out of here?


JAUGHN
Uh, sure! Yeah I can! Just don’t leave me here!




APOLLO

Yeah, whatever. Let’s move!


REBEKAH
Hop in the fighter craft we brought to the docking bay. Hurry!




EBB


Temporary pilot located. Man your stations now.


DESC: 
Steeling himself, Jaughn runs into the spaceship, emerging in the cockpit. After fiddling with the controls for a bit, Jaughn closes the entry door to the ship and takes off.
NOISE
[SFX: Spaceship door closing, spaceship powering up - vrRRRRRRR]
