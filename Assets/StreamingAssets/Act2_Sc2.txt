APOLLO
HAPPY
You ready, new guy? Here comes the first wave of security drones! 


REBEKAH
HAPPY
Just remember how to fly the ship we gave you and you’ll be fine!


EBB
HAPPY
I will be watching for the B O O M S. Don’t disappoint me. 


JAUGHN
NORMAL
I’ll… I’ll do my best.

BREAK
asdf

JAUGHN
Phew, that got a little hairy.


APOLLO
NORMAL
Ebb, you got that satellite up and running?


EBB
HAPPY
Affirmative. That satellite is now as useless to the Coalition as a wet sack of gunpowder. 


REBEKAH
NORMAL
I’m plotting our course to the next satellite. It won’t take long for the Coalition to respond to us.


DESC: 
Coalition Headquarters. The large, shadowy figure from before is seen in a control room.


SHADOWY FIGURE
NORMAL
You have failed to prevent them from taking our satellites. I’m assigning you to deal with the rebels personally. 


Radio Station DJ
NORMAL
But sir… I’m just a radio host.


SHADOWY FIGURE
Oh really? Last I checked you were also our communications director. Do not fail me, or your life will be forfeit.


Radio Station DJ
Ah… yes sir. It’s time to rock.


DESC: 
The crew approaches the third radio station. The space around the radio station is incredibly busy with enemy ships. 
They’ve clearly upped their security. In the center is one massive ship piloted by… a DJ?

EBB
We’re approaching the third station… I’m detecting a massive security force. 


REBEKAH
The Coalition knows we’re here. They’re heading right for us!

Radio Station DJ
Not very righteous of you, dudes. We’ll be taking back our bodacious satellites now.
APOLLO
Oh brother, this guy is trying too hard to sound cool.


JAUGHN
Oh man, is that Treble Make-R in the Morning? I used to listen to his show all the time!


DJ Treble Make-R
NORMAL
Don’t think we haven’t noticed you bogarting our turf. You have exactly one commercial break to lay down your weapons before I drop the beat!
REBEKAH
Uh… well this is not what I was expecting. …Where’s that music coming from?
EBB
It’s coming from the DJ’s ship in the center of the fleet. Let’s turn this boombox into a B O O M box!


APOLLO
He’s coming right at us! Strap in, guys!


DJ Treble Make-R
NORMAL
Let’s rock!!

BREAK
haha
