HAPPY
You ready, new guy? Here comes the first wave of security drones! 


REBEKAH
HAPPY
Just remember how to fly the ship we gave you and you’ll be fine!


EBB
HAPPY
I will be watching for the B O O M S. Don’t disappoint me. 


JAUGHN
NORMAL
I’ll… I’ll do my best.

BREAK

Gameplay (after they clear the first satellite (lvl 1)) Textbox:
JAUGHN
Phew, that got a little hairy.


APOLLO
NORMAL
Ebb, you got that satellite up and running?


EBB
HAPPY
Affirmative. That satellite is now as useless to the Coalition as a wet sack of gunpowder. 


REBEKAH
NORMAL
I’m plotting our course to the next satellite. It won’t take long for the Coalition to respond to us.


BREAK

DESC: 
The scene transitions to the Coalition Headquarters. A grunt approaches a large, shadowy figure.


COALITION GRUNT
NORMAL
Sir, uh, we’ve detected a problem. One of our communication satellites in the Gamma-K3 Sector has been compromised.


SHADOWY FIGURE
…Hmm… Any sign the rebels are behind it?


COALITION GRUNT
It’s too early to tell for sure, but we believe so, sir.


SHADOWY FIGURE
…Get our communications director on the line. Tell him not to allow the rebels to take the remaining satellites, or there will be consequences.


BREAK

Gameplay (start of lvl 2)Textbox:
REBEKAH
HAPPY
We’re in range of the second satellite!
APOLLO
NORMAL
Ah great, they got more goons here. Well, time to get blastin’!


EBB
HAPPY
H e h e h e. I can’t wait to try out my new Protokol Laser Mk. 3 on them. 


JAUGHN
SAD
Ah great… here we go again!






BREAK

Gameplay (after they clear the second satellite (lvl 2) )Textbox:


EBB
The second satellite is now under our control. I’m seeing Coalition signals light up across the board. 
The next battle might get a little crazy. E X C E L L E N T.


REBEKAH
No! Not excellent! There’s a giant fleet of Coalition ships translating into the sector!
APOLLO
We’ve made it this far, no backing down now! Right, Jaughn?


JAUGHN
Y-Yeah, right. H-haha. 


BREAK

DESC: 
The scene transitions to the Coalition Headquarters. The large, shadowy figure from before is seen in a control room.


SHADOWY FIGURE
NORMAL
You have failed to prevent them from taking the second satellite. I’m assigning you to deal with the rebels personally. 


Radio Station DJ
NORMAL
But sir… I’m just a radio host.


SHADOWY FIGURE
Oh really? Last I checked you were also our communications director. Do not fail me, or your life will be forfeit.


Radio Station DJ
Ah… yes sir. It’s time to rock.

BREAK


DESC: 
We see the crew approaching the third radio station. The space around the radio station is incredibly busy with enemy ships. 
They’ve clearly upped their security. In the center is one massive ship piloted by… a DJ?

NOISE
DJ music 

EBB
We’re approaching the third station… I’m detecting a massive security force. 


REBEKAH
The Coalition knows we’re here. They’re heading right for us!


NOISE
[intercom screeching]
Radio Station DJ
Not very righteous of you, dudes. We’ll be taking back our bodacious satellites now.
APOLLO
Oh brother, this guy is trying too hard to sound cool.


JAUGHN
Oh man, is that Treble Make-R in the Morning? I used to listen to his show all the time!


DJ Treble Make-R
NORMAL
Don’t think we haven’t noticed you bogarting our turf. You have exactly one commercial break to lay down your weapons before I drop the beat!
REBEKAH
Uh… well this is not what I was expecting. …Where’s that music coming from?
EBB
It’s coming from the DJ’s ship in the center of the fleet. Let’s turn this boombox into a B O O M box!


APOLLO
He’s coming right at us! Strap in, guys!


DJ Treble Make-R
NORMAL
Let’s rock!!

BREAK
haha
