Urgh… I may fall here, but the Coalition’s work will continue. You can kill the man but not the idea… one day you’ll see! Augh…
JAUGHN
NORMAL
Phew… the fight’s over. But, the star is still in danger of an implosion.
EBB
NORMAL
We have but a few precious minutes to reverse the process. If we return the harvested plasma to the star, its mass may stabilize.

APOLLO
Is there a reverse switch on this hunk of junk?


EBB
No… but we can make one. It will result in the destruction of the star harvester…
REBEKAH
Oh, good-


EBB
…and likely us, but countless lives will be saved.

REBEKAH
Oh.
EBB
There is, however, a slim chance of 5.453E-5% that we can escape in time. No pressure.
JAUGHN
If it avoids this star blowing up countless systems, then it’s worth the risk. Otherwise… It has been an honor to meet all of you.
APOLLO
Ah man… I guess that’s our best shot huh? We’ll have to take those odds.

REBEKAH
I’ll plot the fastest course out of here. Ebb, start the reversal process once you receive the coordinates.
EBB
Coordinates received. Beginning the reversal process now. 

JAUGHN
Everyone! Punch it, now!
BREAK
DESC: 
The Rebellion crew begins their heroic escape sequence. 
In the process, the star harvester begins buckling and shaking under the pressure of the plasma being sent back into the star. 
Within sheer moments, it starts exploding and falling apart.
APOLLO
ANGRY
We’re not going to make it! It was nice knowing you all!
JAUGHN
ANGRY
We have to make it! We have to!
NOISE

PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER
NORMAL
Quick!! No time to explain! We set up a hyperspace slingshot to help you!
REBEKAH
ANGRY
Wait, what?? HOW’D YOU GET THIS THING???
PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER
NORMAL
How do you think I get across the galaxy so quickly? Now move!
JAUGHN
ANGRY
There’s no time! All ships! Into the slingshot, now!

BREAK
DESC: 
Over the course of a few seconds, the rebels all pilot their ships through the slingshot, sending them through hyperspace safely out of the explosion’s path, narrowly avoiding destruction.


JAUGHN
HAPPY
My heart is pounding… we did it, everyone!
NOISE
[Everyone cheers]
EBB
NORMAL
We made it… but I didn’t get to watch the B O O M…
APOLLO
NORMAL
Ah geez, just be grateful you’re alive, bucket-head!


REBEKAH
HAPPY
We accomplished an amazing feat today. Good work everyone!

BREAK
DESC: 
With the galaxy now saved from the threat of annihilation, the rebels celebrate their heroic victory back at their base. Talk of what to do next emerges, after the celebrations conclude.
REBEKAH
NORMAL
With John dead, there’s still splinter groups of the Coalition to take care of. We could use your help still. What do you say, Captain?
JAUGHN
NORMAL
Listen, I appreciate the offer. But I think after the whole “narrowly avoid dying to save the galaxy” situation I need a break. I also think my cat misses me. I’m going home.
APOLLO
I hate to see ya go buddy… you’ll be back though, right?


JAUGHN
If the galaxy’s threatened again, you guys can count on me. I’ll see you around.


EBB
Sniff Oh… I think I’m feeling something called “emotions.” I don’t like it.


REBEKAH
HAPPY
Goodbye Jaughn! You were the best Captain we ever had.
NOISE
[The rebels give Jaughn a round of applause]
DESC: 
Jaughn takes one last look at his new friends, then hops in his ship to leave. 
He waves everyone off, including the new members of the rebellion who joined for the last battle. 
He knew the galaxy was in good hands, and he could return to his home to enjoy some peace… for now.

BREAK
