Urgh… I’ve been taken off the air…


EBB
HAPPY
With that obnoxious yuppie out of the way, we now have control over all three satellites.


REBEKAH
HAPPY
We did it, everyone!


JAUGHN
HAPPY
I can’t believe we survived that! 


APOLLO
HAPPY
Hell yeah!! Ya did good keeping up with us out there!


JAUGHN
HAPPY
Oh shucks. I just tried to stay alive!


REBEKAH

Now we can broadcast our message-


EBB
NORMAL
Hold on. I’m still getting some Coalition communications attempting to pass through this network. Let’s eavesdrop, shall we?

*CRRSSHH* Everything is going according to plan. Our Star Harvester will begin harvesting the hypergiant star in the Apex-12 System. 
Our benefactors will be very pleased!



REBEKAH
SAD
…Hypergiant star?? Those are incredibly unstable! Don’t they realize that harvesting the plasma could cause a hypernova??


APOLLO
SAD
These maniacs are going to blow up the star! That would take out most of the galaxy!!


EBB
NORMAL
As much as I would enjoy the V E R Y  B I G  B O O M, it would seem our next objective is set.


JAUGHN
SAD
I can’t believe this… so many people live in that system. Do they not care at all?


REBEKAH
SAD
Now you understand what’s at stake. The Coalition stopped caring about the consequences of their actions a long time ago.


JAUGHN
NORMAL
We have to stop them! Let’s get a message out across the galaxy!


EBB
NORMAL
Initializing broadcast…


DESC: 
Attention all Milky Way citizens! Your Intragalactic Coalition has failed you! 
They’re planning on harvesting the plasma from the hypergiant star in the Apex-12 System! 
This would threaten the entire system and have untold consequences for the whole galaxy! 
Their unending quest for natural resources will result in YOUR death! 
If you’re brave enough to fight for your freedom, join the Rebellion! 
All capable fighters, meet us at Proximus-3 in the Apex-12 System!

JAUGHN
NORMAL
(inner monologue) Now we just hope our message didn’t fall on deaf ears… this next battle could be our last.
DESC: 
The message rang loud and clear across communications devices everywhere in the galaxy. 
The crew of the Rebellion hoped their message wouldn’t fall on deaf ears. 
They knew the next battle could very well be their last…
