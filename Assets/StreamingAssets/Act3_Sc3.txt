DESC: 
Meanwhile, the large, shadowy figure from before is seen boarding a ship for the Apex-12 System. 


SHADOWY FIGURE
So, that’s their plan then. They’ll all be gathered in one place… taking care of them will be easy. Nothing will threaten the Coalition’s plans.

DESC: 
With the Coalition’s security force out of the way, the area around Proximus 3’s orbit is now clear. 
The crew sat patrolling around the moon, waiting for anyone who might have heard their message…


APOLLO
NORMAL
So this is it, huh? Doesn’t look like anyone’s showing up.


REBEKAH
NORMAL
Patience isn’t your strong suit, Apollo. They’ll get here. I’m sure of it…


JAUGHN
If even just a few people show up, we’ll be all the better for it.


DESC: 
A few moments pass. Suddenly, the crew hear the beeping of their radar.
EBB


I’m picking up several signals approaching us. They’re… not Coalition signals. Opening comms. 



DESC: 
One by one, random civilian crafts start warping into the sector. 
Doctors, farmers, chefs, politicians, people from all walks of life are here. 
Even… pizza delivery drivers…

PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER
Hey guys! Are we late? I hope not, I don’t want to lose my tip.


JAUGHN
ANGRY
YOU?! What are you doing here?! You got me arrested!!


PIZZA DELIVERY DRIVER
NORMAL
Wait, really? Sorry about that, my friend. I just saw a fight comin’ on, and since the Coalition keeps taking my tip money, I decided to help out. 
Let me make it up to you! Anyone order a side of GUNS?
DESC: 
The delivery sign on the roof of his ship transforms into a gun. The other ships prepare their weapons, as well. 


Random Civilian
We’re here to fight too!


Mathematically Predictable Civilian
Got your message!


JAUGHN
HAPPY
Thank you, everyone! With your help, we can win this!


EBB
NORMAL
I’m picking up the Coalition’s signal near the hypergiant star. The ship they have there is… massive. Damage to the star is ongoing.


REBEKAH
I’m navigating us there now. Everyone, follow us and prepare to fight!

DESC: 
The Rebellion crew, with the civilian fighters in tow, have cleared their way to the hypergiant star in the center of the system. 
A giant, vacuum-like mechanical ship can be seen orbiting around it, sucking in plasma from the star.


JAUGHN
ANGRY
What in blazars IS that thing??


APOLLO
ANGRY
It’s… sucking the energy out of the star like some kind of giant vacuum!


EBB
ANGRY
The star is incredibly unstable. An implosion… followed by a B I G BOOM is imminent. 


REBEKAH
SAD
We need to figure out a way to destroy it now or it will be too late!


DESC: 
The fighters cautiously but urgently approach the giant ship. Their comms are suddenly interrupted by a strangely familiar voice…
JOHN
SAD
Intruders, you are hereby ordered to surrender or be destroyed. You have caused untold damage to the Coalition. I won’t ask again.


APOLLO
NORMAL
Wait… that voice. I know that voice.


REBEKAH
ANGRY
What the f- JOHN? 


JAUGHN
ANGRY
Me?


REBEKAH
NORMAL
No!


EBB
ANGRY
The previous Captain? He’s still alive?


JOHN
NORMAL
Oh yes. Did you think I would be killed so easily?


APOLLO
ANGRY
Yeah, we thought you were dead! What are you doing working for the Coalition??


JAUGHN
ANGRY
Wait, who is this? I’m the Captain now, identify yourself!


JOHN
NORMAL
Oh you poor fools, you didn’t tell him? I’m John, the REAL Captain, and you bought my act hook, line, and sinker. 
I was simply undercover in your little club, so deep undercover in fact that I pretended to get arrested! 
Your path here was entirely staged by me. I arranged for Jaughn to be put in my cell. 
It was by my hand that you rescued this… faker instead of me.


JAUGHN
NORMAL
Faker?? Wait a minute, I think you’re the fake Jaughn here!


JOHN
NORMAL
And now you’ve brought the entire rebellion here. You’ve fallen right into my trap. 
Our weapon here has absorbed enough solar plasma to kill you all in one blast. 
And once you’re gone, peace will be restored to the galaxy.


APOLLO
SAD
Peace?? You call this peace??


JOHN
NORMAL
Yes, order leads to peace. You have done nothing but undermine our order, which has led to chaos. 
Don’t you realize the coalition maintains our fragile relationship with our neighboring galaxy?


JAUGHN
NORMAL
I once believed in that lie, but you’re all just a bunch of greedy hacks who will stop at nothing to keep your sham of a relationship going. 
What good is “order” when you’re killing innocent civilians??


JOHN
I guess you’re too short-sighted to realize that the ends justify the means. The Coalition has led to the betterment of mankind, and our benefactors desperately need this star’s plasma. 
We are simply here to provide.


REBEKAH
SAD
But by harvesting the plasma, you’re going to blow up the star! You’re going to cause countless deaths throughout the galaxy! 
The needs of the few don’t outweigh the needs of the many!


JOHN
SAD
Very well, I guess I’ll just have to MAKE you see our side of things! Engage the Star Harvester’s Weapons Platform!


JAUGHN
NORMAL
This is it! Get ready everyone!
